Odd Fixes
============
Pachouli lines added to build.gradle (data, server, gametestserver)
Refactored Client setup - Allowing MP server use
Fixed overlooked cut_lock in color swap logic - cause client crash - attempting to apply Direction.Axis to a block that doesn't support it
--  This is reliant on assuming that base versions & red versions are base Minecraft (example, cut_sandstone & cut_red_sandstone, not directional.. while the modded cut blocks are)
Fixing Sandstone class extending genBlock instead of Block directly
